# Time Logger Local Timesheet App

### For when you can't remember what you did 10 minutes ago, let alone Monday.

Work can get quite busy, so I created this little app to run on my local machine while I'm working away. 
Will allow me to easily keep track of how long I was in meetings, doing training, working on that project, 
writing that report, making a brew .. the list continues of course.

##### Was a really nice return to .Net Framework after so long in Javascript land. If you this would be useful to you, steal it, amend it, use it. I'd be honoured.
